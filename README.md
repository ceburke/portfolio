This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i
# run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/portfolio](http://localhost:3000/portfolio) with your browser to see the result.

Most changes will show up automatically although some changes, like adding a new postData, may require re-running `npm run dev`.

## Deploying

Deployment is done automatically on pushes to main with a github actions workflow. The same workflow can be triggered manually.
