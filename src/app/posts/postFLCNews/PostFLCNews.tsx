        title="Fort Lewis College News Redesign"
        description="The Fort Lewis College News site is a central marketing and storytelling tool for the college, showcasing events, achievements, and strategic initiatives. However, the outdated, non-branded, and unresponsive design created barriers for users and limited its effectiveness in broader marketing efforts like fundraising, outreach, and email campaigns. This redesign transformed the News site into a modern, responsive platform that aligns with the collegeâ€™s brand and enhances usability for all audiences."
